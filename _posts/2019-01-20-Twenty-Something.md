Hello world, I am officially 22 and I have no idea what comes next. Plus, waking up with a hangover and a post music show depression. Cheers!

I haven't done this in a while, so I don’t really know when to start (lmao who am I kidding. I just wrote a bunch of phony words 6 days ago...). Lately I've been stumbling through life quite bad, I guess? I should have written a tech article instead of my so-called daily life, but who cares. A 22-year-old girl with her life lying splintered on the floor can do whatever she wants on her birthday.

The thought of being an irresponsible 22-year-old kiddo is terrifying. That kid still hopelessly sabotages her life in the hope of rebuilding it from scratch. At the age of 22, that kid just wishes she could master the art of expecting nothing from people and be a real person.

Now let's see what 21-year-old me has had in a year: a second breakup, a rebound crush, matches on Tinder which she has never talked to, a stratocaster guitar named "shirostrato-san" (what a mouthful name!), mediocre stuff written in phony words, zero spiritual growth, etc. What an adventurous life you have led, 21-year-old Quynh Anh. Proud of you, mate.

To celebrate my not-so-awesome presence on earth, I went to a music show at HRC alone yesterday. The show was supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, yikes! Standing in the corner with a bottle of beer in my hand, I was lost yet I was totally okay with that feeling surprisingly. No friends, no lovers, no family, just a 22-year-old girl who tried to fake it through the day. At that moment, I realized that I didn't have to like somebody or pursue love after love to define myself. I can be alone. I don't have to find a persona, or define myself anymore. Just keep floating on earth is enough. Just floating. And kid, that how a girl got over her rebound crush on a her birthday at a music concert with some help from alcohol and good music. Still, damn my heart, damn my lesbianism, I unluckily had another crush on a total stranger. I'm sure it will fade in a day or two, though. Now I'm just haunted by the potential energy. Suddenly **Loud Places** was playing in my head at that moment *"I go to loud places to search for someone to be quiet with who will take me home"*. 

I met TA after her over-the-top performance. All her songs hit my heart so hard with a feeling of being lost and the acceptance of a fact that no one will save you at the end of the day. We talked a little bit. She was high (which I only knew after reading her instagram story), I was drunk. We ranted about the pain of being adults, the pain of compromising with life and family, our love for Solanin, our letdowns for life. "Happy birthday, em", she said. I really hope she can do what she wants with music and feel contented. A genuine artist, a genuine human being. Not like me, a kid who adjusts her personalities in a way that appeals to those she wants to like. She had to leave before the show ended, thus I was alone again after bidding her farewell. The show must go on, life must go on. DA's Angels was on stage while I was standing so close to the girl I had a crush on. Yet nothing happened. No one took me home except a Grab biker lol. A crushing feeling of emptiness and despair has been drowning me this morning with a remnant of memories from last night. 22, huh. I wonder how many more times will I ever experience the feeling like I did last night. The fear of growing up and responsibilities of real world are upon me. I have to fight and compromise with my life. Yet I'm not ready for it. Just let me be alone. I am still not a real person.
